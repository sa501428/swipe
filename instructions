design a web game (html/js/css only) meant to run full screen on mobile. 
it's a simple game, as soon as web page opened, will go directly into the game and you keep playing.
Score counter in the corner. 

Should have nice graphics, ideally using web gl or similar

game mechanic is that random objects will either fly across the screen or either emerge in a parabolic arc (as though tossed)
the user needs to swipe and cut the objects in half
successfully swiping on the object will cause it to break, and the user will get points
